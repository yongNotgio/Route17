# Route17
This project is a Flutter-based mobile app that helps commuters in Iloilo City find the correct jeepney route using their current location and chosen destination. The app suggests which jeepney to ride, where to get on and off, and if a transfer is needed. Its goal is to make commuting easier and more organized for students, residents, and visitors.
